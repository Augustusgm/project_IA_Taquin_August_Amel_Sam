# project_IA Taquin_Augustin_Amelie

Building a taquin (n-sliding puzzle and solving it with different search algorithms

## Necessary Modules:

pip install 'prompt_toolkit'

pip install 'heapdict'

sudo apt install python3-tk

## Running the code

#### A first way, the GUI

run test_interface.py file (python3 test_interface.py)

In the interface you can choose the size of your taquin (3, 8, 15, ...) and mix it several time or choose it directly thanks to file button (you have to first write your taquin in fichier.txt)
Then you can solve it by moving the tiles directly on the screen or thanks to different buttons which get the solution (path)

#### Second way: solve.py
