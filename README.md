pip install 'prompt_toolkit'

pip install 'heapdict'

sudo apt install python3-tk

To run the code you have a first way : run test_interface.py :
In the interface you can choose the size of your taquin and mix it several time or choose it directly thanks to file button (you have to first write your taquin in fichier.txt)
Then you can solve it by moving the tiles directly on the screen or thanks to different buttons which get the solution (path)

Second way is by running the solve.py file
